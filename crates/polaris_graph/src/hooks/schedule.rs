//! Schedule markers for graph execution lifecycle events.
//!
//! These marker types identify when hooks are invoked during graph execution.
//! Use them with [`ScheduleId::of::<T>()`](polaris_system::plugin::ScheduleId::of)
//! for registration, or use the type-safe registration methods like
//! [`register_observer::<OnSystemStart>`](super::HooksAPI::register_observer).
//!
//! # Pure Markers
//!
//! Schedule markers are pure marker types implementing the [`Schedule`] trait.
//! Event data is provided via the unified [`GraphEvent`](super::events::GraphEvent)
//! enum, which all hooks receive.
