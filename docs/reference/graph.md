# Graph Execution

Agent logic in Polaris is expressed as a directed graph of systems and control flow constructs. The `polaris_graph` crate provides the graph structure, a builder API for constructing it, and an executor for running it.

## Graphs

A `Graph` is a directed graph where nodes represent computation or control flow and edges define the connections between them. The graph is constructed using a builder API that handles node allocation, edge creation, and subgraph composition.

```rust
use polaris_graph::Graph;

let mut graph = Graph::new();
graph
    .add_system(receive_input)
    .add_system(reason)
    .add_system(respond);
```

The first node added becomes the graph's entry point. Each subsequent call to the builder connects the new node to the previous one via a sequential edge. This implicit chaining means that for linear pipelines, the builder reads as a sequence of steps.

Before execution, a graph can be validated via `graph.validate()`, which checks that: the graph has a valid entry point; all edges reference valid nodes; decision and switch nodes have the required predicates and branches; parallel nodes have branches and a join target; loop nodes have a body and termination condition or iteration limit; and join nodes have source nodes. Advanced checks include verifying that loop termination predicates can read outputs produced within the loop body, and warning about conflicting output types in parallel branches.

## Construction Patterns

### Sequential

Systems are connected in order. Each `add_system` call appends a node and links it to the previous one.

```rust
graph
    .add_system(reason)
    .add_system(act)
    .add_system(respond);
```

### Conditional Branch

A decision node evaluates a typed predicate against a system output and routes execution to one of two subgraphs. The type parameter specifies which system output type to read (e.g., `Out<ReasoningResult>`), and the predicate closure receives a reference to that output and returns a boolean.

```rust
graph
    .add_system(reason)
    .add_conditional_branch::<ReasoningResult, _, _, _>(
        "should_use_tool",
        |result| result.needs_tool,
        |g| g.add_system(execute_tool),
        |g| g.add_system(respond),
    );
```

After the selected branch completes, execution continues from the decision node's next sequential edge.

### Multi-Way Branch

A switch node evaluates a discriminator against a system output that returns a string key, then routes to the matching case subgraph. The type parameter specifies which system output type to read (e.g., `Out<ClassificationResult>`), and the discriminator closure receives a reference to that output and returns a case key.

```rust
graph
    .add_system(classify)
    .add_switch::<ClassificationResult, _, _>(
        "route",
        |result| result.category,
        vec![
            ("question", |g: &mut Graph| { g.add_system(answer); }),
            ("task", |g: &mut Graph| { g.add_system(execute); }),
        ],
        Some(|g: &mut Graph| { g.add_system(fallback); }),
    );
```

### Parallel Execution

A parallel node forks execution across multiple subgraphs. Each branch receives its own child context. Branches run concurrently — if any branch fails, the remaining branches are cancelled and the error propagates.

A join node is automatically created after the parallel branches. It serves as a synchronization point; execution continues from the join node once all branches complete.

```rust
graph
    .add_system(plan_tools)
    .add_parallel("execute_tools", vec![
        |g: &mut Graph| g.add_system(tool_a),
        |g: &mut Graph| g.add_system(tool_b),
    ])
    .add_system(aggregate_results);
```

### Loop

A loop node repeats its body subgraph until a termination predicate returns true or an iteration limit is reached. The termination predicate is evaluated before each iteration. The context persists across iterations, so outputs from iteration N are available to iteration N+1.

```rust
graph.add_loop::<LoopState, _, _>(
    "react_loop",
    |state| state.is_done || state.iterations >= 10,
    |g| {
        g.add_system(reason)
         .add_system(act)
         .add_system(observe);
    },
);
```

For loops that should run a fixed number of times without a predicate, `add_loop_n` accepts only an iteration count.

## Nodes

Nodes are the vertices of the graph. Each node has a unique ID allocated.

```rust
pub enum Node {
    System(SystemNode),
    Decision(DecisionNode),
    Switch(SwitchNode),
    Parallel(ParallelNode),
    Loop(LoopNode),
    Join(JoinNode),
}
```

Most builder methods return `&mut Self` for chaining. When a `NodeId` is needed (for example, to attach an error handler), `add_system_node` returns the ID directly.

## Edges

Edges define the connections between nodes. They are stored in a flat vector alongside the nodes.

```rust
pub enum Edge {
    Sequential(SequentialEdge),
    Conditional(ConditionalEdge),
    Parallel(ParallelEdge),
    LoopBack(LoopBackEdge),
    Error(ErrorEdge),
    Timeout(TimeoutEdge),
}
```

`SequentialEdge` connects one node to the next and is the primary mechanism for linear flow. The builder creates these automatically when chaining nodes.

`ErrorEdge` and `TimeoutEdge` define fallback paths from a system node to a handler subgraph.

`LoopBackEdge` connects the end of a loop body back to the loop node.

## Execution

The `GraphExecutor` traverses a graph starting from the entry node, executing each node and following edges to determine the next step.

```rust
pub struct GraphExecutor;

impl GraphExecutor {
    pub async fn execute(
        &self,
        graph: &Graph,
        ctx: &mut SystemContext<'_>,
        hooks: Option<&HooksAPI>,
    ) -> Result<ExecutionResult, ExecutionError>;
}
```

When a system returns a value, the executor inserts it into the context's output storage keyed by `TypeId`. Downstream systems access it via `Out<T>`, which fetches from the same storage. If multiple systems return the same type, the last write wins. Outputs persist for the duration of graph execution.

Subgraph execution (branches, loop bodies, case handlers) is recursive with depth tracking. The default recursion limit is 64.

## Error Handling

### Error Edges

When a system node fails, the executor checks for an `ErrorEdge` from that node. If one exists, execution continues at the error handler subgraph. If none exists, the error propagates and execution stops.

```rust
let risky_id = graph.add_system_node(risky_operation);
graph.add_error_handler(risky_id, |g| {
    g.add_system(fallback_operation);
});
```

### Timeout Handling

A system node can have a timeout set via `set_timeout`. The executor wraps the system call in `tokio::time::timeout`. If the timeout elapses, the executor checks for a `TimeoutEdge`. If one exists, execution continues at the timeout handler. If none exists, the executor returns `ExecutionError::Timeout`.

```rust
let slow_id = graph.add_system_node(slow_operation);
graph.set_timeout(slow_id, Duration::from_secs(5));
graph.add_timeout_handler(slow_id, |g| {
    g.add_system(timeout_fallback);
});
```

## Hooks

The hook system provides extension points for observing and modifying graph execution at specific lifecycle events. Hooks are registered by plugins during the build phase via `HooksAPI` and invoked by the executor at runtime.

There are two kinds of hooks. **Observer hooks** are side-effect-only callbacks for logging, metrics, and tracing. **Provider hooks** inject resources into the `SystemContext` before a system executes, making them available to the system via `Res<T>`.

### Schedules

Each hook is registered against one or more schedule types. The executor invokes hooks for a given schedule at the corresponding point in graph traversal. All hooks receive a `&GraphEvent` and match on the relevant variant for typed access.

**Graph-level:** `OnGraphStart`, `OnGraphComplete`, `OnGraphFailure` — fired before execution begins, after it completes, and when it fails.

**System-level:** `OnSystemStart`, `OnSystemComplete`, `OnSystemError` — fired around each system node's execution.

**Decision:** `OnDecisionStart`, `OnDecisionComplete` — fired before a decision node evaluates its predicate and after a branch has executed.

**Switch:** `OnSwitchStart`, `OnSwitchComplete` — fired before a switch node evaluates its discriminator and after a case has executed.

**Loop:** `OnLoopStart`, `OnLoopIteration`, `OnLoopEnd` — fired before the loop begins, at the start of each iteration, and after the loop completes.

**Parallel:** `OnParallelStart`, `OnParallelComplete` — fired before parallel branches start and after all branches complete.

When multiple hooks are registered for the same schedule, they execute in registration order, and each hook sees context changes made by previous hooks.

### DevToolsPlugin

`DevToolsPlugin` demonstrates provider hooks. It registers a hook on `OnSystemStart` that injects `SystemInfo` into the context before each system executes. Systems can then access the current node ID and system name via `Res<SystemInfo>`:

```rust
#[system]
async fn my_system(info: Res<SystemInfo>) {
    println!("Running node {:?}: {}", info.node_id(), info.system_name());
}
```
